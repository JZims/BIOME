# This is BIOME - Beverage Inventory Ordering & Management Environment

A lightweight management utility for updating a rotating list of beverages daily.

As an admin user, you can log in, create other users, grant admin access to other duties such as ordering and editing items.

You can also send each item to a daily manifest and submit it to the backend to keep stock current.


Future goals include:

 - CSV upload to inventory
 - A "Well" UI for monitoring open bottles behind the bar
 - A dynamic BIN system for keeping stock organized and accounted for
